# LeetCode problems and their practical use cases
This project is an attempt to make coding problems more interesting by thinking of practical use cases for them. 

## Problems
1. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters and DNA sequencing](longest_consecutive_sequence.md)
2. [Lowest Common Ancestor and network routing](lowest_common_ancestor.md)

## Samples
